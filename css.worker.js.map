For scalable fonts, the font-size is a scale factor applied to the EM unit of the font. (Note that certain glyphs may bleed outside their EM box.) For non-scalable fonts, the font-size is converted into absolute units and matched against the declared font-size of the font, using the same absolute coordinate space for both of the matched values.\",\n            \"restrictions\": [\n                \"length\",\n                \"percentage\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"font-size-adjust\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"E79\",\n                \"FF40\",\n                \"C43\",\n                \"O30\"\n            ],\n            \"values\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"none\",\n                    \"description\": \"Do not preserve the font’s x-height.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"syntax\": \"none | <number>\",\n            \"relevance\": 50,\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"Preserves the readability of text when font fallback occurs by adjusting the font-size so that the x-height is the same regardless of the font used.\",\n            \"restrictions\": [\n                \"number\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"font-stretch\",\n            \"values\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"condensed\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"expanded\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"extra-condensed\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"extra-expanded\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"narrower\",\n                    \"description\": \"Indicates a narrower value relative to the width of the parent element.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"normal\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"semi-condensed\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"semi-expanded\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"ultra-condensed\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"ultra-expanded\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"wider\",\n                    \"description\": \"Indicates a wider value relative to the width of the parent element.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"syntax\": \"<font-stretch-absolute>{1,2}\",\n            \"relevance\": 53,\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-stretch\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"Selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font family.\",\n            \"restrictions\": [\n                \"enum\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"font-style\",\n            \"values\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"italic\",\n                    \"description\": \"Selects a font that is labeled as an 'italic' face, or an 'oblique' face if one is not\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"normal\",\n                    \"description\": \"Selects a face that is classified as 'normal'.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"oblique\",\n                    \"description\": \"Selects a font that is labeled as an 'oblique' face, or an 'italic' face if one is not.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"syntax\": \"normal | italic | oblique <angle>{0,2}\",\n            \"relevance\": 84,\n            \"references\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-style\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"description\": \"Allows italic or oblique faces to be selected.
